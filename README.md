# deepclaw

Talk to your OpenClaw over the phone **or** in a Discord voice channel using the [Deepgram Voice Agent API](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent).

## Why Deepgram?

| | ElevenLabs | Deepgram |
|---|---|---|
| **Turn detection** | VAD-based | Semantic (Flux) |
| **TTS latency** | ~200ms TTFB | 90ms TTFB |
| **TTS price** | $0.050/1K chars | $0.030/1K chars |
| **Barge-in** | Basic VAD | Native StartOfTurn |

Deepgram Flux understands *when you're done talking* semantically and acoustically—not just when you stop making noise. This means fewer awkward interruptions and faster responses.

## Provider Comparison: Twilio vs Telnyx

| Feature | Twilio | Telnyx |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Moderate | Easy |
| **Phone Number Cost** | ~$1/month | ~$0.50-$2/month |
| **Call Pricing** | $0.085/min | $0.005-$0.025/min |
| **Media Streaming** | WebSocket + TwiML | WebSocket + REST API |
| **Authentication** | Account SID + Auth Token | API Key + Public Key |
| **Documentation** | Extensive | Growing |
| **Global Coverage** | Excellent | Excellent |

**Recommendation:**
- **Twilio**: Better for production apps with extensive docs and ecosystem
- **Telnyx**: More cost-effective, simpler API, better for experimenting

## Discord Voice Channels

Already have OpenClaw's Discord bot running? deepclaw doesn't need a second bot token — OpenClaw's built-in Discord extension already handles joining voice channels, capturing audio, and playing back speech. All you need to do is configure OpenClaw to use **Deepgram** for its STT and TTS, then run the deepclaw LLM proxy server as usual.

### How it works

OpenClaw's Discord voice pipeline:

```
Discord Voice Channel
    │ Opus audio (captured by OpenClaw's Discord bot)
    ▼
OpenClaw – STT (Deepgram Nova-2)
    │ transcript
    ▼
OpenClaw – LLM  ←──proxy──→  deepclaw /v1/chat/completions
    │ text reply
    ▼
OpenClaw – TTS (Deepgram Aura-2)
    │ audio
    ▼
Discord Voice Channel (played back by OpenClaw's bot)
```

OpenClaw handles the entire Discord bot side (`/vc join`, `/vc leave`, audio capture, playback). deepclaw just runs the LLM proxy server, exactly the same as for phone calls.

### Quick start

#### 1. Configure Deepgram TTS in OpenClaw

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and add a TTS configuration under your Discord channel entry:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "voice": {
        "enabled": true,
        "tts": {
          "provider": "deepgram",
          "providers": {
            "deepgram": {
              "apiKey": "your_deepgram_api_key",
              "model": "aura-2-thalia-en"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you want Deepgram Nova-2 for STT as well, set it in your OpenClaw media understanding config:

```json
{
  "mediaUnderstanding": {
    "provider": "deepgram",
    "providers": {
      "deepgram": {
        "apiKey": "your_deepgram_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Enable OpenClaw chat completions (optional)

This is only needed if you want to run deepclaw's LLM proxy alongside OpenClaw's voice pipeline (e.g., for markdown stripping). Skip if you want OpenClaw's built-in pipeline to handle everything directly.

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```
#### 3. Start the deepclaw LLM proxy

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN in .env (same as phone setup)
python -m deepclaw
```

#### 4. Join a voice channel in Discord

Use OpenClaw's built-in `/vc join` slash command to join a voice channel. OpenClaw will speak using Deepgram Aura-2 TTS and transcribe with Nova-2.

### Customizing the voice

Change the `model` value in the TTS config in `openclaw.json`:

| Voice | Style |
|-------|-------|
| `aura-2-thalia-en` | Feminine, American (default) |
| `aura-2-orion-en` | Masculine, American |
| `aura-2-draco-en` | Masculine, British |

See `skills/deepclaw-voice/SKILL.md` for the complete voice list.

## How It Works

deepclaw uses the [Deepgram Voice Agent API](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent)—a single WebSocket that handles STT, TTS, turn-taking, and barge-in together.

```
Phone Call → Twilio/Telnyx → deepclaw ←──WebSocket──→ Deepgram Voice Agent API
                                │                      (Flux STT + Aura-2 TTS)
                                │
                                ↓
                           OpenClaw (LLM)
```

1. You call your phone number
2. **Twilio/Telnyx** streams audio to deepclaw via WebSocket
3. deepclaw forwards audio to Deepgram Voice Agent API
4. Flux transcribes with semantic turn detection
5. Deepgram calls your LLM endpoint (OpenClaw via deepclaw proxy)
6. Aura-2 speaks the response, streamed back through your phone provider

**Barge-in support:** Start talking while the assistant is speaking and it stops immediately—handled natively by the Voice Agent API.

## Quick Setup (Let OpenClaw Do It)

The easiest way to set up deepclaw is to let your OpenClaw do it for you:

```bash
# Copy the skill to your OpenClaw
cp -r skills/deepclaw-voice ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

Then tell your OpenClaw: **"I want to call you on the phone"**

OpenClaw will walk you through:
- Creating a Deepgram account (free $200 credit)
- Setting up a Twilio phone number (~$1/month)
- Configuring everything automatically

## Manual Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/) (free tier available, $200 credit)
- **Phone Provider** (choose one):
  - [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/) with a phone number (~$1/month)
  - [Telnyx account](https://telnyx.com/) with a phone number (~$0.50-$2/month)
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) running locally
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for exposing your local server

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepgram/deepclaw.git
cd deepclaw
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

**For Twilio (default):**
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
VOICE_PROVIDER=twilio
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your_openclaw_gateway_token
```

**For Telnyx:**
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
VOICE_PROVIDER=telnyx
TELNYX_API_KEY=your_telnyx_api_key
TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY=your_telnyx_public_key
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your_openclaw_gateway_token
```

### 3. Configure OpenClaw

Enable the chat completions endpoint in your `openclaw.json`:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```

deepclaw automatically creates a dedicated `voice` agent in OpenClaw that uses a fast model (Claude Haiku 4.5) for low-latency phone conversations. This happens on first `python -m deepclaw` launch. To customize the model:

```bash
# Use a different model for voice (optional)
export OPENCLAW_VOICE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

Or create the agent manually:

```bash
openclaw agents add voice --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

### 4. Start the tunnel

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Note your ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`).

```

The Voice Agent API handles the entire speech pipeline in a single WebSocket connection. deepclaw bridges Twilio's media stream to the Voice Agent API and proxies LLM requests to your local OpenClaw.

## Customizing Voice

deepclaw uses Deepgram Aura-2 TTS with 80+ voices in 7 languages. Edit `voice_agent_server.py`:

```python
"speak": {
    "provider": {
        "type": "deepgram",
        "model": "aura-2-orion-en",  # Change voice here
    },
},
```

**Popular voices:**
| Voice | Style |
|-------|-------|
| `aura-2-thalia-en` | Feminine, American (default) |
| `aura-2-orion-en` | Masculine, American |
| `aura-2-draco-en` | Masculine, British |
| `aura-2-estrella-es` | Feminine, Mexican Spanish |
| `aura-2-fabian-de` | Masculine, German |

See `skills/deepclaw-voice/SKILL.md` for the complete voice list (80+ voices in 7 languages), or test voices at https://playground.deepgram.com/

## Security Considerations

Be aware of these security considerations when using OpenClaw and deepclaw. Like the rest of OpenClaw, use at your own risk.

**1. LLM proxy endpoint has no authentication**
- The `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is unauthenticated
- Anyone who discovers your ngrok URL can use your OpenClaw/Anthropic API credits
- **Mitigation:** Keep your ngrok URL private. Consider using a fixed ngrok domain.

**2. No Twilio signature validation**
- Incoming webhook requests are not verified as coming from Twilio
- **Mitigation:** For production, add [Twilio request validation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security#validating-requests)

**3. Credentials in `.env` file**
- API keys and tokens are stored in plaintext
- **Mitigation:** The file is gitignored. Set restrictive permissions: `chmod 600 .env`

**4. ngrok exposes your local machine**
- Your server is accessible from the internet while running
- **Mitigation:** Only run when needed. Use ngrok's IP allowlist on paid plans.

**For production deployments**, consider:
- Adding Twilio signature validation
- Running behind a reverse proxy with rate limiting
- Using a dedicated server instead of ngrok
- Implementing proper authentication on the LLM proxy

## Known Limitations

**OpenClaw streaming latency:** OpenClaw's `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint currently buffers responses for ~5 seconds before streaming begins. This adds latency to LLM responses regardless of which voice provider you use (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, etc.).

The initial greeting is instant (generated by Deepgram), but subsequent responses wait for OpenClaw's buffer.

This is an upstream limitation. OpenClaw's native WebSocket agent endpoint streams properly, but external voice APIs require the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint.

## Coming Soon
