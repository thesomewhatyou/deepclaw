# deepclaw

Talk to your OpenClaw over the phone **or** in a Discord voice channel using the [Deepgram Voice Agent API](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent).

## Why Deepgram?

| | ElevenLabs | Deepgram |
|---|---|---|
| **Turn detection** | VAD-based | Semantic (Flux) |
| **TTS latency** | ~200ms TTFB | 90ms TTFB |
| **TTS price** | $0.050/1K chars | $0.030/1K chars |
| **Barge-in** | Basic VAD | Native StartOfTurn |

Deepgram Flux understands *when you're done talking* semantically and acoustically—not just when you stop making noise. This means fewer awkward interruptions and faster responses.

## Provider Comparison: Twilio vs Telnyx

| Feature | Twilio | Telnyx |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Moderate | Easy |
| **Phone Number Cost** | ~$1/month | ~$0.50-$2/month |
| **Call Pricing** | $0.085/min | $0.005-$0.025/min |
| **Media Streaming** | WebSocket + TwiML | WebSocket + REST API |
| **Authentication** | Account SID + Auth Token | API Key + Public Key |
| **Documentation** | Extensive | Growing |
| **Global Coverage** | Excellent | Excellent |

**Recommendation:**
- **Twilio**: Better for production apps with extensive docs and ecosystem
- **Telnyx**: More cost-effective, simpler API, better for experimenting

## Discord Voice Channels

Don't want to pay for a phone number? deepclaw can join Discord voice channels instead.

> **Note:** OpenClaw already handles Discord *text* natively through its built-in Discord extension. deepclaw adds *voice channel* support — your OpenClaw speaks and listens inside a voice channel, powered by the same Deepgram pipeline.

### How it works

```
Discord Voice Channel → deepclaw bot ←──WebSocket──→ Deepgram Voice Agent API
                              │                      (Nova-2 STT + Aura-2 TTS)
                              │
                              ↓
                         OpenClaw (LLM)
```

1. You run `/join` in your Discord server
2. The bot joins your voice channel
3. deepclaw streams your voice to Deepgram Voice Agent (48 kHz linear16, no resampling)
4. Deepgram transcribes, calls OpenClaw for a response, and synthesises speech
5. The bot plays the reply back in the voice channel
6. **Barge-in:** Start talking while the bot is responding — it stops immediately

### Prerequisites

- A [Discord Application with a Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/) (free $200 credit)
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) running locally with `chatCompletions` enabled
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) so Deepgram can reach the LLM proxy on your machine

### Quick start

#### 1. Create a Discord bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → **New Application**
2. Navigate to **Bot** → **Add Bot**
3. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Server Members Intent** and **Message Content Intent**
4. Copy the **Token** — this is your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
5. Under **OAuth2 → URL Generator**, select scopes `bot` + `applications.commands`
   and permissions **Connect**, **Speak**, **Use Voice Activity**
6. Open the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

#### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
VOICE_PROVIDER=discord
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your_openclaw_gateway_token
```

#### 3. Enable OpenClaw chat completions

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```

#### 4. Start the tunnel

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g. `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`) into `PUBLIC_URL` in your `.env`.

#### 5. Start deepclaw

```bash
python -m deepclaw
```

#### 6. Join a voice channel and call `/join`

In Discord, join any voice channel and type `/join`. The bot will join you and say hello. Talk naturally — barge-in is supported.

When you're done, type `/leave`.

```

### Customising the Discord voice

Edit `discord_voice_server.py`, find `get_agent_config()`, and change the `model` in `speak`:

```python
"speak": {
    "provider": {
        "type": "deepgram",
        "model": "aura-2-orion-en",  # Change voice here
    },
},
```

## How It Works

deepclaw uses the [Deepgram Voice Agent API](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent)—a single WebSocket that handles STT, TTS, turn-taking, and barge-in together.

```
Phone Call → Twilio/Telnyx → deepclaw ←──WebSocket──→ Deepgram Voice Agent API
                                │                      (Flux STT + Aura-2 TTS)
                                │
                                ↓
                           OpenClaw (LLM)
```

1. You call your phone number
2. **Twilio/Telnyx** streams audio to deepclaw via WebSocket
3. deepclaw forwards audio to Deepgram Voice Agent API
4. Flux transcribes with semantic turn detection
5. Deepgram calls your LLM endpoint (OpenClaw via deepclaw proxy)
6. Aura-2 speaks the response, streamed back through your phone provider

**Barge-in support:** Start talking while the assistant is speaking and it stops immediately—handled natively by the Voice Agent API.

## Quick Setup (Let OpenClaw Do It)

The easiest way to set up deepclaw is to let your OpenClaw do it for you:

```bash
# Copy the skill to your OpenClaw
cp -r skills/deepclaw-voice ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

Then tell your OpenClaw: **"I want to call you on the phone"**

OpenClaw will walk you through:
- Creating a Deepgram account (free $200 credit)
- Setting up a Twilio phone number (~$1/month)
- Configuring everything automatically

## Manual Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/) (free tier available, $200 credit)
- **Phone Provider** (choose one):
  - [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/) with a phone number (~$1/month)
  - [Telnyx account](https://telnyx.com/) with a phone number (~$0.50-$2/month)
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) running locally
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for exposing your local server

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepgram/deepclaw.git
cd deepclaw
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

**For Twilio (default):**
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
VOICE_PROVIDER=twilio
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your_openclaw_gateway_token
```

**For Telnyx:**
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
VOICE_PROVIDER=telnyx
TELNYX_API_KEY=your_telnyx_api_key
TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY=your_telnyx_public_key
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your_openclaw_gateway_token
```

### 3. Configure OpenClaw

Enable the chat completions endpoint in your `openclaw.json`:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```

deepclaw automatically creates a dedicated `voice` agent in OpenClaw that uses a fast model (Claude Haiku 4.5) for low-latency phone conversations. This happens on first `python -m deepclaw` launch. To customize the model:

```bash
# Use a different model for voice (optional)
export OPENCLAW_VOICE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

Or create the agent manually:

```bash
openclaw agents add voice --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

### 4. Start the tunnel

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Note your ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`).

### 5. Configure Your Phone Provider

#### Option A: Configure Twilio

1. Go to your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Navigate to Phone Numbers → Manage → Active Numbers
3. Click your number
4. Under "Voice Configuration":
   - Set "A Call Comes In" to **Webhook**
   - URL: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/twilio/incoming`
   - Method: **POST**
5. Save

#### Option B: Configure Telnyx

1. Go to your [Telnyx Mission Control Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/)
2. Navigate to **Voice → Programmable Voice**
3. Create a new **Voice API Application**:
   - **Application Name**: `deepclaw-voice`
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/telnyx/webhook`
   - **Webhook API Version**: `API v2` (recommended)
   - **Webhook Failover URL**: (optional) same as webhook URL
4. Click **Create**
5. Go to **Numbers → My Numbers**
6. Click your phone number
7. Under **Voice Settings**:
   - **Connection**: Select your `deepclaw-voice` application
8. Save configuration

#### Getting Telnyx API Keys

1. In Mission Control Portal, go to **API Keys**
2. Create a new API Key or copy existing one
3. For **Public Key**: Go to **Account → Public Key** and copy the key

### 6. Start deepclaw

```bash
python -m deepclaw
```

### 7. Call your number

Pick up the phone and talk to your OpenClaw!

```

The Voice Agent API handles the entire speech pipeline in a single WebSocket connection. deepclaw bridges Twilio's media stream to the Voice Agent API and proxies LLM requests to your local OpenClaw.

## Customizing Voice

deepclaw uses Deepgram Aura-2 TTS with 80+ voices in 7 languages. Edit `voice_agent_server.py`:

```python
"speak": {
    "provider": {
        "type": "deepgram",
        "model": "aura-2-orion-en",  # Change voice here
    },
},
```

**Popular voices:**
| Voice | Style |
|-------|-------|
| `aura-2-thalia-en` | Feminine, American (default) |
| `aura-2-orion-en` | Masculine, American |
| `aura-2-draco-en` | Masculine, British |
| `aura-2-estrella-es` | Feminine, Mexican Spanish |
| `aura-2-fabian-de` | Masculine, German |

See `skills/deepclaw-voice/SKILL.md` for the complete voice list (80+ voices in 7 languages), or test voices at https://playground.deepgram.com/

## Security Considerations

Be aware of these security considerations when using OpenClaw and deepclaw. Like the rest of OpenClaw, use at your own risk.

**1. LLM proxy endpoint has no authentication**
- The `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is unauthenticated
- Anyone who discovers your ngrok URL can use your OpenClaw/Anthropic API credits
- **Mitigation:** Keep your ngrok URL private. Consider using a fixed ngrok domain.

**2. No Twilio signature validation**
- Incoming webhook requests are not verified as coming from Twilio
- **Mitigation:** For production, add [Twilio request validation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security#validating-requests)

**3. Credentials in `.env` file**
- API keys and tokens are stored in plaintext
- **Mitigation:** The file is gitignored. Set restrictive permissions: `chmod 600 .env`

**4. ngrok exposes your local machine**
- Your server is accessible from the internet while running
- **Mitigation:** Only run when needed. Use ngrok's IP allowlist on paid plans.

**For production deployments**, consider:
- Adding Twilio signature validation
- Running behind a reverse proxy with rate limiting
- Using a dedicated server instead of ngrok
- Implementing proper authentication on the LLM proxy

## Known Limitations

**OpenClaw streaming latency:** OpenClaw's `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint currently buffers responses for ~5 seconds before streaming begins. This adds latency to LLM responses regardless of which voice provider you use (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, etc.).

The initial greeting is instant (generated by Deepgram), but subsequent responses wait for OpenClaw's buffer.

This is an upstream limitation. OpenClaw's native WebSocket agent endpoint streams properly, but external voice APIs require the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint.

## Coming Soon

- **Local wake-word mode** — Talk to OpenClaw hands-free at your desk, no phone needed
- **One-click desktop installer** — No terminal required
- **Native OpenClaw plugin** — Install with one command
